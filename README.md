On a day-to-day basis, Valkiiren wears a large leather trench coat with a large emblem on the back centre, usually covered by a backpack and a shield. This emblem is his mentor’s family crest (The Warwicks).
Under his trench coat, on his left is a leather holster, with a midnight black revolver being held within’ it. Unlike most revolvers, this one seems to have a triple barrel, and for the magically inclined, enchanted.
