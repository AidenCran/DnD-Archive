On a day-to-day basis, Valkiiren wears a large leather trench coat with a large emblem on the back centre, usually covered by a backpack and a shield. This emblem is his mentor’s [Clan's Crest](./WarwickClan.md) (The Warwicks).
Under his trench coat, on his left is a leather holster, with a midnight black revolver being held within’ it. Unlike most revolvers, this one seems to have a triple barrel, and for the magically inclined, enchanted.

</p>
This gun was crafted by Valkiiren's Mentor as a gift to Valkiiren. It's crafted with wolves at the end, as Lucian still believes that the spirit of past Riders will protect those who are worthy to be called Riders.

Through months of Tinkering with various types of magic and metals, identifying their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities for improvement, Valkiiren has created something unique. Valkiiren has discovered, by imbuing metals with a finely tuned magic similar to the type used to create his Homunculus servant, he creates a more powerful beast.
